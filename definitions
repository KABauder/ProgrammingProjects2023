Definitions + questions


----------Dec 20th-----------

Cloud -> uses servers distributed throughout the world.
server -> stores all data associated with a website.

Does appending to a list add it to the end or the beginning?
-> it adds it to the end

How do I add functions to a class in Python?
-> define the class, then for each function do
def func(self,a,b):
-> need to add self to it, because it adds the self as an argument?

Reading lines in a file, how do you get to them?
-> you have to open the file, iterate through the lines, then close it at the
end
-> you have to use 'a' to append to a file

GET and POST for a server
-> GET is used when I only want to retrieve info from a server
-> POST is when I also want to send info to a server, like a web form

SQL is a database.
-> structured query language

Email works on SMTP -> simple mail transfer protocol
-> protocols are what are used to access servers

DNS -> Domain Name Server
-> used to access websites based on the address name

FTP -> file transfer protocols
-> for servers where users transfer files to one another

Does Google, Amazon, Meta have their own data centers?
-> They do, yes, and I've been to one at The Dalles, Oregon

What happens if a data center gets destroyed? Is the data lost?
-> the data should have nodes connected to other data centers so
the amount of data lost is minimal; however, yes you could permanently
wipe out some data.

There is permeability between text files and the python script
-> you can touch other files from your main python script

-> reading text files, writing to them
-> in essence, changing another file through python

Can you delete your own system data through a python script?
-> you can power off the computer with a Python system script
-> you could overload memory, but this would just require a reboot
-> you can delete system files if you have authorization
-> you can use a fork bomb to exponentially use memory

What are cookies?
Ways to get personal information from a user's computer


--------------Dec 21st--------------
What is Front End development?
-> It uses Javascript + CSS + HTML to create what the user sees.

CSS -> cascading style sheets
Javascript -> an object oriented language that allows interactive parts of a website.

API -> Application Programming Interface
-> how two pieces of software communicate and interact with each other.
-> clients send a request, and servers send back a response.
-> ex: a mobile weather app sends a request to the weather database server.

REST API -> Representational State Transfer
-> a set of functions that clients can use to access server data.

API integrations -> automatically update data between clients and servers.
-> ex: photos being automatically synced to the Cloud

Authentication tokens -> used to make sure an API is secure.

There is communication between apps and servers
-> the user interacts with the frontend, which connects to the backend through
an API.
-> Requests and responses are like a waiter or messenger.
-> I interact with the application or website, and it sends it to the server.

RESTful APIs -> should be stateless, each request is independent.

Some Frontend frameworks used with HTML + CSS + Javascript
-> React, Vue.js, Angular

----------Dec 23rd----------------
DevOps
-> allows a version to be sent to production without downtime

Vim
-> allows you to edit code from within the shell

git status -> see what changes need to be commited
git add . -> adds all documents in current working directory
git push -f -> pushes changes, overriding the main
git pull -> pulls from the main repository
git init -> initializes a new local repository
git remote add origin -> connects remote repository to local one
git checkout -> goes back to an old commit
git branch -> lists the branches

You have to push code to github in order to change the main repository
You have a local version of the repository and a main branch
You have to make sure you fetch other peoples changes before you commit

In bash:
touch -> used to create an empty file
echo -> a way to display text with changes
